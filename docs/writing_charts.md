# Charts

- Introduce Helm. Stick to the parts that include its templating abilities, and how it helps the user construct Kubernetes objects
- Take the user through the following:
  - creating a chart
  - Validating it
  - Packaging it
  - Uploading it to our instance of chart museum
- Explain what we expect charts to look like (i.e. 1 deployment, 1 service)
- Point the user toward the [helm chart template guide][] to learn more about the syntax
