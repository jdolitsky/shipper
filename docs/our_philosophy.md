Our philosophies are not meant to blind us to good suggestions. They
are meant to serve as guidelines for our decisions, and to help others
better understand the decisions we've made. None of the items below
are set in stone, and we'll always try to have an open mind.

# The Kubernetes way over any other way

# Doing one thing efficiently over doing multiple things inefficiently

# Transparency over abstraction

# Teaching over hand-holding
